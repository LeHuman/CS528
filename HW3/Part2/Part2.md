# Part 2

## Design and Implementation

The design of this cryptographic protocol is fairly simple. The sender simply send their public key to the receiver alongside their matrix where every elemenet is encrypted.
The receiver can then run caclculations on this matrix, encoding their own values to be used in calculations where applicable.
Finally the receiver sends back the final calculation to the sender.
